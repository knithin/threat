Required Changes to Make the Script Work
Feed URLs and Types:
Replace the placeholder feed URLs (https://example.com/threat-feed1.json, etc.) in the CONFIG["feeds"] dictionary with actual threat intelligence feed URLs.
Ensure the feed type (json or rss) is accurate for each feed.

SMTP Configuration:
Update the CONFIG["smtp"] dictionary with valid SMTP server credentials: 
server: Your SMTP server address (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
port: SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS).
username: Your email address.
password: Email password or app-specific password.
recipient: Email address to receive alerts.

Threat Feed Data Structure:
Confirm the JSON structure of your feeds aligns with the parsing logic in process_feed(). Adjust the keys ("indicator", "severity", etc.) if necessary to match the feed format.

Dependencies:
Install required Python libraries:
pip install requests
For RSS/XML feeds, you might need feedparser:
pip install feedparser

Database Initialization:
Ensure the script has permission to create and write to threats.db in the working directory.

RSS/XML Parsing (Optional):
If working with RSS/XML feeds, implement parsing using feedparser or xml.etree.ElementTree in the process_feed() function.

Testing:
Test with live feeds and adjust error handling (try/except blocks) for edge cases, such as timeouts, malformed data, or empty feeds.
